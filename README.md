## Introducing Myself 👋

Hi There! I'm Faraz, a Data Analyst with strong software engineering experience, passionate about building scalable solutions and uncovering insights from data.

### Personal Statement 💻 
I have a solid foundation in Software Engineering and love the challenge of both coding and analysis. I’ve worked across the stack with Java, Python, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and REST APIs. My projects often blend analytical thinking with software development, from creating interactive front ends to designing backend logic.

📊 On the data side, I work with:
* Power BI for building insightful dashboards
* SQL for complex querying and data modelling
* Excel for data analysis, automation (with formulas & VBA), and reporting

💻 On the software engineering side, I work with:
* Java and Spring Boot to build robust backend applications and RESTful APIs
* React and JavaScript for creating interactive and responsive front-end interfaces
* Node.js and Express for lightweight server-side development
* Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration

🛠️ Tools:
* Languages: Java, Python, SQL, JavaScript
* Frontend: React, HTML, CSS
* Backend: Node.js, Express
* Data Tools: Power BI, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Excel, Google BigQuery
* Other: Git, VS Code, Spring Boot, REST APIs


I'm always looking to bridge the gap between data and code - whether it's visualising trends, optimising systems, or delivering business value through clean, functional applications.
